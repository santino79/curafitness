                <h2>What is the 15 Week Challenge?</h2>
                There is an old adage in the fitness world that you can't out-train a bad diet. 
                And goodness knows that each year that passes has proven it to many of us.
                <br /><br />
                Training hard, be it in small group sessions, bootcamps, online or with a personal trainer, 
                is the best way to get ourselves fitter, healthier and stronger.
                <br /><br />
                But to truly get into the physical shape we want, we need the expert guidance of a qualified nutrionist 
                and the accountability to make sure we stick to their guidance.
                <br /><br />
                <em><strong>This is what you get from the Cura Fitness 15 Week Challenge.</strong></em>


                <h2>What do you get?</h2>
                <ul>

                    <li>Nutritional guidance from up to date evidence based Nutritionist</li>

                </ul>               

                But most of all it's the added self-confidence and self-esteem that you can get from making tough changes to your lifestyle and getting the results you want at the end.

              Congratulations to the Winner of The 15 Week Challenge Cathy Corbett who lost -32.7 inches along with -23.9lbs!!🥳
              <br /><br />
              Cathy religiously sent her food diaries to me every week, homecooked meals to suit her family, along with next days lunch, 
              and took on all of my feedback throughout. 
              <br /><br />
              A few of Cathy's inch losses were...-5.8 inches off both arms, -4 inches off her chest, -4 inches off her waist, 
              -7.3 inches off her belly button, -4.7 inches off her hips and -6.9 inches off both legs. 
              <br /><br />
              Her shape has progressively changed throughout and she is also fitter and stronger. Incredible progress! 
              Below is Cathy's review of the Challenge and her journey so far👇
              <br /><br />
              "I first joined Cura as part of the summer PAYG classes. As someone who hadn't exercised in a while due to having kids 
              and the pandemic - I was initially wary of how I would cope with it. To my surprise I ended up really enjoying it. So much so I signed up for the bootcamps and then the 15 week challenge. 
              The challenge was just what I needed. There was no point exercising if I was going to sabotage the hard work with a poor diet. 
              <br /><br />
              Knowing I had feedback from Liz when I submitted my food diaries really ensured I paid attention to my meals. 
              The support network of the others in the challenge was immeasurable. Great for recipe ideas and always a boost to know that if you had a bad day...that was fine...you could always press re-start the next day.
              6am starts aren't always easy - but when you come out knowing you pushed yourself and had a great laugh while doing 
              so...well that's a good start to your day! 
              <br /><br />
              The challenge allows you to re-train your attitude towards food - incentivising you to put the effort in - 
              especially when you can clearly see how your shape and indeed your mental health is changing for the better.
              <br /><br />
              I love being part of Cura and I look forward to it being an important part of my fitness journey for a long time to come."
              <br /><br />
              Thank you so much for this Cathy, really means so much, and I'm so incredibly proud of you x

            Congratulations to the runner up of The 15 Week Challenge Charlene Ogle who lost -27.1 inches along with -17.8lbs! 
            A few of Charlene's losses were: 
            -4.5 inches off both arms, -3.3 inches off her chest, -6.6 inches off her belly button, -3 inches off her hips, -5.5 inches off her legs. 
            <br /><br />
            Absolutely incredible Char! With the combination of Bootcamp, x1 Group Personal Training session each week (benching 45kg no less!!), 
            and the added accountability of sending me your food diary in every week. 
            <br /><br />
            Charlene's review is below: 
            <br /><br />
            "I decided to sign up for the 15 week challenge having previously completed last year's Christmas challenge a
            nd seeing great results. I knew being part of the challenge was just the accountability I needed to stay focused 
            and with Liz's advice and guidance I knew I could achieve great results again.
            <br /><br />
            At the the start of the challenge I set myself 3 mini goals I wanted to achieve in the 15 weeks<br />
            1. Fit back into a dress I wore to my friends 40th <br />
            2. Get down to the last hole in my work belt<br />
            3. Get under 80kg
            <br /><br />
            Thankfully through my training, Liz's nutritional advice and all the encouragement and great recipes for all the other 
            lady's taking part in the challenge I manged to achieve all 3 of my goals and great inch loss all over.
            <br /><br />
            I am now going into the festive season feeling great in myself but also  with a healthier outlook 
            and much more knowledge about fueling my body.
            Thank you Liz and all the other ladies for the encouragement, advice, recipes and support in the 15 week challenge"
            <br /><br />
            Thank you so much, Charlene. Not only for this but your constant support over almost 6 years. Incredibly lucky to have you as a friend.

            <br /><br />
            Even though Joanna was unable to commit to this current Bootcamp, we focused on purely her nutrition, 
            and she stayed as active as possible, which proves how important nutrition is. Super proud of you, Joanna, well done!

            A few of Joanna's losses were -3 inches off her arms, -2.5 inches off her chest, -3.8 inches off her waist,

            Joanna very kindly send me a review of her journey👇
            <br /><br />
            "I first joined Cura in Jan 22 to participate in boot camps. I wasn’t sure what to expect but right from then I was hooked. 
            I made great new friends while building up my own strength and fitness.
            <br /><br />
            All was going well but after a summer of too many holidays and treats the 15 week challenge was just what 
            I needed to get back on track. Having to complete my food diary meant I could see exactly what I was eating. 
            I am a VERY fussy eater so poor Liz was constantly questioned what was OK for me to eat. 
            The girls in the group also posted lots of great ideas which also helped keep me going.
            <br /><br />
            I also had my own challenges along the way with birthdays and mini breaks away with hotel breakfasts 
            but I made it work by hitting the gym at 7 in the morning before going for breakfast.
            <br /><br />
            Thank you to Liz for all your help, support and guidance, I couldn’t have done it without you."
            <br /><br />
            Thank you very much for this! So appreciated, and you've been such a great support to me and those at Cura x

            Congratulations to Beverley who came 5th in The 15 Week Challenge and lost -23.1 inches along with -12.5lbs!🥳
            <br /><br />
            Beverley previously won the Spring Into Summer Challenge, and she continued on with her progress losing -33.1 inches since April to now, 
            along with -33lbs (over 2 stone!!)
            Since April she has -7.4 inches off her hips alone!! Her shape has totally changed as well! Incredible, 
            and a true example that making the challenge a part of your daily lifestyle is what it's all about. 
            <br /><br />
            Beverley's review is below👇
            <br /><br />
            "I joined Cura in January 2021, when classes were on Zoom. I knew I needed to build up my fitness and lose weight, 
            especially after a diagnosis of a serious spinal problem. Ever since, I’ve been grateful to Liz for her attention to detail 
            and how she offers adjustments to work around back problems. 
            <br /><br />
            I managed to keep showing up 3 times each week and saw big improvements in my fitness and strength. 
            Eventually, after ups and downs with weight, I realised how important nutrition was and how it works hand-in-hand with the exercise. 
            Around Easter this year, I recognised that I needed a system of advice and accountability in equal measure 
            and I had good results from the Spring into Summer Challenge. I wanted to sustain that and joined this challenge too.
            <br /><br />
            The weekly feedback about food diaries was exactly what I needed, so I could track and change habits quickly. 
            I’ve learnt to make different choices and I think we now have a healthier household as a result.
            <br /><br />
            This challenge was a difficult time for us as a family and I had to take some time away from bootcamp. 
            Despite that break, I’ve lost inches and weight and am so relieved to have found a sustainable system of being healthier.
            <br /><br />
            I’ve managed to avoid surgery so far and hope to keep investing the time and effort in Cura to maintain and improve on my progress.
            For anyone who is thinking of joining Bootcamp or PT, I can’t recommend Liz highly enough. 
            <br /><br />
            She is a talented and compassionate instructor and values each of us individually. 
            And don’t be put off if you’re starting from zero fitness. If I can get this far, 
            anyone can and the team of women at Cura will support you with kindness and humour every step of the way."
            <br /><br />
            Thank you very much for this lovely review, Beverley, and for your friendship these past 3 almost 3 years. Very proud of you!

            "This is my 6th time doing a 15 week challenge with Cura and every time I've achieved amazing results as well as enjoying birthdays 
            and trips away etc, all guilt free. Each time I've taken part in the challenge I've learnt something new about nutrition, 
            tried some lovely recipes and picked up plenty of tools to keep my goals on track. Liz has a wealth of knowledge 
            and provides detailed feedback each week to help you achieve your goals. The support provided by Liz 
            and the rest of the girls on the challenge has been second to none and I can't wait to sign up to the next challenge already!!

            8 Weeks of taking part in The 15 Week Challenge, Bootcamp along with 4 weeks of (one session per week of) small group personal training

            Charlene was recently diagnosed with under-active Thyroid and thankfully with the correct medication and consistent training/nutrition 
            she is seeing incredible changes after a long run there of feeling frustrated at training hard and seeing no progress. 
            <br /><br />
            This is why I'm grateful that through my Mac Nutrition qualification 
            i'm able to get alongside my clients with underlying health issues, and support them as much as possible. 
            <br /><br />
            So proud of you Charlene. Thank you for not giving up, and also for trusting me. Keep the fantastic work👏

              Congratulations to the amazing Marion who came 1st and won the 15 Week Challenge!!👑
              <br /><br />
              The 1st photo was in August (right before the Challenge started), and the 2nd was taken 17th December. 
              <br /><br />
              Marion lost -30.8 inches along with -24.4lbs!! 
              <br /><br />
              She lost -4 inches off her arms, just over -8 inches off her chest + waist, -6.5 inches off her belly button, -5 inches off her hips, -6.5 inches off her thighs + calves. 
              <br /><br />
              She looks like a different person, and so toned! And Marion brought her food diary in every week for review, and ate such a varied diet - but fish + salad was definitely her go-to, along with nuts, seeds and also the intermittent fasting worked exceptionally well for both Marion, and her partner Denise (who came 2nd🥳!).
              <br /><br />
              Marion initially came to me during lockdown to start building her core, due to bulging discs in her back. She also has struggled with a few other injuries along the way but we always adapted and she has gone from strength to strength 💪 I am so proud of you, Marion, and couldn't ask for a better friend/s in my life (including Denise of course) as you 2 always encourage, support and look after me, so thank you❤
              <br /><br />
              Delighted for you!!

              A massive congratulations to Claire, who came 3rd in the 15 Week Challenge and lost -24.9 inches, along with -13.2lbs!🥳
              <br /><br />
              Claire lost a massive -8 inches from her belly button alone! Along with -4 off her arms, -4.5 off waist + chest, -8.5 off hips + legs!!
              <br /><br />
              As everyone knows, this is not Claire's first rodeo when it comes to Challenges! This is her second time now achieving great success, as in the 2019 Challenge she came 1st and lost -22 inches along with just over 1 stone. So she actually lost most inches this year than ever. 
              <br /><br />
              The difference this year too, is that Claire regularly attends x2 Group Personal Training sessions per week, Circuits twice per week, and has been doing Pilates once a week for the past month to improve flexibility. She brought her food diary in every week for review and took on all of my feedback. She enjoyed birthdays, anniversary etc and certainly did not deprive herself. We were working on variety, food to fuel training and help to benefit health. I even got her taking fish oils🙌
              <br /><br />
              I have no words for how proud I am of Claire. She has been my go-to over the past 3 years, especially during lockdowns and Challenges. She has become a great friend outside of work, and I think she is one of the best ladies I know when it comes to integrity and loyalty. 
              <br /><br />
              Outstanding work, Claire!👏

              One of the highlights of 2021 was meeting this outstanding lady, Clare. We never would have met if it weren't for Zoom, and she has done incredibly well - as you can see the top photos were January 2021, and the bottom were taken today! Wow!! Same top - and it's literally becoming a dress! And check out the tone!!😮
              <br /><br />
              Clare came 8th in the 15 Week Challenge with -15.7 inches off, along with just under half a stone in weight🥳she joined as she "needed more Liz time in her life"(her words😂) so fair play haha!
              <br /><br />
              However bigger picture! Since January she has lost 30 inches and her shape has completely changed. 
              <br /><br />
              Clare attends a Group Personal Training session, along with a 1:1 Personal Training session a week with myself. Once a week she also tries to complete one of my HITT sessions from our Facebook group (free to current clients) as we have found the combination works really well for her. 
              <br /><br />
              I am so proud of you, Clare. Not only fantastic results, but you're a fantastic person who puts 100% into everything. To see you grow in confidence this past few months makes me so happy, and you have been such a great support to me too, so thank you xx

              Sandra lost -6.5 inches off her arms, -4 inches off her chest + waist, -4.5 inches off her hips, -4.5 off her legs. 
              <br /><br />

              Sharon has been with me now for almost 3 years, and this is the 2nd Challenge she has taken part in and done brilliant with her results. She has still enjoyed nights out, etc but has been consistent with her training and we definitely know accountability works best for Sharon.

              In her journey as a whole with Cura she has lost -24 inches! With -4.5 inches off her arms, -3 inches off her chest, -3 inches off her waist, -6 inches off her belly button, -3 inches off her hips, -4.5 off her legs.
              <br /><br />
              I'm so so proud of you, Sharon, and thank you for sticking by me these 3 years. You are such a great support to me, and look forward to continuing in January with Bootcamp            <br /><br />

                <br /><br />
                Better late than never (on my part)....a review by our 15 Week Challenge winner, Claire Campbell - thank you so much for this!
                <br /><br />
                "<strong>My 15 week challenge at Cura.</strong>
                <br /><br />
                I have really enjoyed taking part in this challenge. From the outset Liz provided us all with a wealth of information on eating well, providing a comprehensive booklet including tips on what we should and shouldn’t eat.
                <br /><br />
                She also included recommendations based on what she eats herself, which was really useful. At the start it was a bit difficult to get my head round the 40/30/30 percentage splits, but the app Liz recommended is excellent for keeping track of everything.
                <br /><br />
                Along with this Liz monitored my food diaries and let me know what changes to make, as a result I got the hang of it all pretty quickly with Liz’s support.
                <br /><br />
                Following Liz’s advice I started to see the results pretty quickly and I have to say I am eating more now than I have ever eaten before! Of course during the 15 weeks life goes on and I had family birthdays, my own birthday, wedding anniversary, nights out, overnight business trips, school mid-term, etc etc, all during this time. And I enjoyed every minute of these and didn’t deny myself anything!
                <br /><br />
                I just made sure that a ‘day off plan’ didn’t turn into a ‘week off plan’ (it may have turned into a couple of days here and there J) and I got straight back on the wagon knowing Liz was monitoring my food diary!
                <br /><br />
                I think this is why the 15 weeks has just flown in – I managed to achieve amazing results whilst still enjoying normal activities. What I’m taking from it is that it is a lifestyle change, one that I can maintain long term and not just a fad diet.
                <br /><br />
                During the 15 weeks I attended Liz’s boot camp classes 3 times a week and the circuits and ab blast on a Saturday morning. I really enjoy these classes as each and every one is different.
                <br /><br />
                Over the 15 weeks I feel my fitness has increased significantly, I am able to push myself harder and I’m lifting heavier weights. I see the benefits in my day to day life, such as my posture is improved, I’ve more energy for running after the kids and the classes are a real stress buster!
                <br /><br />
                So although the challenge has come to an end, this is just the start for me– Liz has given me the tools and knowledge for me to keep going.
                <br /><br />
                Thanks so much to Liz, Trisha and Steph – I couldn’t have achieved what I have without your support and encouragement."            <br /><br />
