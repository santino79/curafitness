<h2>MONEY BACK GUARANTEE</h2>
As per the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 you are entitled to cancel your membership and receive a full refund of any fees paid within 14 days of completing your membership application form. However, as per regulation 36 of Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, if you select to commence your membership immediately, or you ask us to start your membership early, you agree that if you subsequently cancel your membership within the 14 day period, you will be refunded any monies paid, less an amount for the membership you have already used. As an example of how this works, if your membership fee is £60 per month and you cancel your membership after 10 days of it commencing (having asked us to start it immediately) we shall refund you £40, keeping £20, which represents the membership you had used up to the point of cancellation.
 

<h2>TERMINATION</h2>

    You may terminate your membership at any point by cancelling your direct debit with your bank, allowing 3 to 4 working days for the bank to action this. Please notify Cura Fitness for options available to you or for any further information.

    <li>
    In the above circumstances your membership will remain in force until the day before your next payment is due, at which point it will automatically terminate.
    </li>
</ol>
 

<h2>PRICES</h2>
From time to time we may need to increase the price of membership. We will give you at least 1 full months’ notice of any incoming price increase and will make it very clear when the price increase will take effect and how much your membership will cost after the increase. During this period you will have your usual right to terminate your membership in accordance with the membership terms and conditions and rules. If you do not terminate the membership by the date given to you in the notice then the price of your membership will be increased in accordance with our notice.
