            <br /><br />
            Better late than never (on my part)....a review by our 15 Week Challenge winner, Claire Campbell - thank you so much for this!
            <br /><br />
            "<strong>My 15 week challenge at Cura.</strong>
            <br /><br />
            I have really enjoyed taking part in this challenge. From the outset Liz provided us all with a wealth of information on eating well, providing a comprehensive booklet including tips on what we should and shouldn‚Äôt eat.
            <br /><br />
            She also included recommendations based on what she eats herself, which was really useful. At the start it was a bit difficult to get my head round the 40/30/30 percentage splits, but the app Liz recommended is excellent for keeping track of everything.
            <br /><br />
            Along with this Liz monitored my food diaries and let me know what changes to make, as a result I got the hang of it all pretty quickly with Liz‚Äôs support.
            <br /><br />
            Following Liz‚Äôs advice I started to see the results pretty quickly and I have to say I am eating more now than I have ever eaten before! Of course during the 15 weeks life goes on and I had family birthdays, my own birthday, wedding anniversary, nights out, overnight business trips, school mid-term, etc etc, all during this time. And I enjoyed every minute of these and didn‚Äôt deny myself anything!
            <br /><br />
            I just made sure that a ‚Äòday off plan‚Äô didn‚Äôt turn into a ‚Äòweek off plan‚Äô (it may have turned into a couple of days here and there J) and I got straight back on the wagon knowing Liz was monitoring my food diary!
            <br /><br />
            I think this is why the 15 weeks has just flown in ‚Äì I managed to achieve amazing results whilst still enjoying normal activities. What I‚Äôm taking from it is that it is a lifestyle change, one that I can maintain long term and not just a fad diet.
            <br /><br />
            During the 15 weeks I attended Liz‚Äôs boot camp classes 3 times a week and the circuits and ab blast on a Saturday morning. I really enjoy these classes as each and every one is different.
            <br /><br />
            Over the 15 weeks I feel my fitness has increased significantly, I am able to push myself harder and I‚Äôm lifting heavier weights. I see the benefits in my day to day life, such as my posture is improved, I‚Äôve more energy for running after the kids and the classes are a real stress buster!
            <br /><br />
            So although the challenge has come to an end, this is just the start for me‚Äì Liz has given me the tools and knowledge for me to keep going.
            <br /><br />
            Thanks so much to Liz, Trisha and Steph ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt have achieved what I have without your support and encouragement."            <br /><br />

            Liz has been great helping me, even though I stress her sometimes with my weekends out (!!)) but with her support and help I‚Äôve been able to achieve my goals and have had amazing results."

            The fabulous Tina Gartland is a different woman & has been with us since her trial week a year ago. She is part of the furniture, only missing classes to go on holiday, but ALWAYS working her training around her work schedule. She inspires others with her dedication. We are so proud of you Tina, & know Eva is too.

            Here is Tina‚Äôs testimonial as featured in Banbridge Chronicle:
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúI joined Cura Fitness in January 2018. At that time, due to bad health, I had gained a bit of weight which was getting me down!
            <br /><br />
            I had tried lots of different gyms, but hadn‚Äôt lost anything and was starting to loss hope! At Cura Fitness, I was made very welcome and at ease, as Liz was aware of my health conditions and told me to just go at my own pace and how to adapt the exercises that I wasn‚Äôt able to do!
            <br /><br />
            After a short space of time I could see my body shape changing, which encouraged me to keep at it! From I joined cura I have not only lost weight but my health both physically and mentally has improved. I also don‚Äôt feel like I am being judged for the things I can‚Äôt do as there are a lot of people who have health conditions which restricts what they can do, so everyone is so supportive!
            <br /><br />
            Through Cura I have made some lovely friends! My life has changed for the better which is all down to Cura Fitness and all their guidance and support‚Äù.

            Thank you to Charlene Ogle for her brilliant review below. We continue to be so very proud to have you as a member at Cura Fitness. You are driven, motivated & committed which is why you deserve these brilliant results.
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúI joined Cura Fitness almost one year ago and and am loving it and the results.
            I have tried many different gyms and exercise classes but never stuck them out, Cura Fitness changed all that. From the first time i entered Cura Fitness i was made to feel very welcome by both the Cura team and the other members and for once i didnt feel out of place in a gym setting.
            <br /><br />
            I attend Cura 3 times a week and do a variety of classes including circuits, core and RT24. There really is something to suit everyone.
            My body shape has really improved, im much more toned, so much fitter and above all so much happier in myself.
            <br /><br />
            I can‚Äôt recommend Cura Fitness highly enough, it is really great fun, good laugh and it works. The atmosphere is non judgemental and all the girls encourage each other.
            <br /><br />
            Thank you everyone at Cura Fitness for helping me achieve my goals‚Äù

            So proud of my lovely PT Client, Catherine, who first came on with us through Boot Camp one year ago. She did brilliantly well during the 6 weeks, and lost -18 inches. After which, she joined as a Member and continued to grow in strength and fitness.
            <br /><br />
            In September she came on with me as a PT Client and took part in the 15 Week Challenge. The other 2 ladies in her PT group were a brilliant support, and really rallied behind Catherine as week after week she continued to progress in every way. Catherine lost 17 inches during the Challenge and a total of 17.8lbs! This was with a few trips away and other events thrown into the mix.
            <br /><br />
            Around this she worked really hard to plan her meals and stay consistent in her nutrition. As a result she came 6th in the Challenge üéâAnd in her One Rep Max Squat Test before Christmas she achieved a ORM of 107.5kg. Outstanding!
            <br /><br />
            Catherine has lost a total of -3.5 off her arms, -3 inches off her chest, -4 inches off her waist, -6.5 inches off her belly button, -3 inches off her hips and a massive 10 inches off both legs!
            <br /><br />
            Catherine's Review after the 15 Week Challenge üëá
            <br /><br />
            "I‚Äôve been a member at Cura almost 1 year now. My goals when joining were to lose weight, get fit and find something that I enjoy so that I can stick with! During this time I am happy to say I have achieved all 3 goals.
            <br /><br />
            When Liz announced the 15 week challenge I was definitely keen to take part. This was the extra push and motivation that I needed after enjoying the summer üòä
            <br /><br />
            During these 15 weeks there were many challenges, between holidays and weekends away. Liz was always on hand offering support and guidance at any time it was needed, night or day. Whether it was suggestions on food options, and just the general encouragement that I needed.
            <br /><br />
            Liz also went out of her way to accommodate any weigh-ins/measurements, always at a time suitable for me even when she was not due to be working. I don‚Äôt know of anywhere else you would get this level of commitment."
            <br /><br />
            So proud of you and what you have achieved, Catherine, and I know will continue to achieve in 2020!            <br /><br />

            Sarah McCahon, we are all SO proud of your progress in (almost) the last year. Sarah is so dedicated, that she was back in training on the 27th December as soon as we re-opened after the Christmas break. You deserve these fab results, Sarah, & you‚Äôre looking amazing!!

            Read Sarah‚Äôs testimonial below:
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúAfter feeling I needed to do something to lose weight, a friend recommended Cura to me and it honestly was the best decision I could have made to join in April 18. I have met some amazing people and made some life friends through the classes and instructors.
            <br /><br />
            They are always there to help motivate and give advice and are always there to help me along the way. Since joining, I have lost a total of 21.5 inches, have gained more confidence in myself and it has helped dramatically with my anxiety and overthinking.
            <br /><br />
            There is such a variety of classes to choose from each week and I would highly recommend Cura Fitness to anyone who wants and is willing to make a change in their life for the better. I could not speak highly enough of the instructors and honestly could not have got to where I am today without them.‚Äù

            Thank you so much for these fantastic photos Linda Wills along with your brilliant testimonial below. We love having you as part of Cura. You show such strength & dedication. Your body shape has changed completely & we are all so proud of you.
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúI joined Cura Fitness in March 2018 after winning a Facebook competition for one months free classes. Once i started i was instantly hooked. I hadn‚Äôt exercised in some time and was fearful getting back into exercise due to underlying health conditions, however i was worrying for nothing.
            <br /><br />
            The small group size suited me brilliantly and i felt like no-one was judging me if i was slow or didn‚Äôt know the exercises. Liz was always on hand to adjust any i was having difficulty with and i always felt that i left the classes feeling a great sense of achievement.
            <br /><br />
            Ten months later i am loving exercise again! I am stronger fitter and healthier than i have been in some time having lost over 35 inches to date and have a new found love of burpees and while i still have challenges at times i‚Äôm excited to see what 2019 brings. Thank you Cura!‚Äù

            I am SO proud of this amazing lady, who I am privileged to call my friend, & one of the most kindest, loyal people I know ‚Äì Audrey Docherty.
            <br /><br />
            She has been by my side from that first trial week in Jan ‚Äô18 at the Rugby Club & still attends her 3 morning classes every week, no matter the weather.
            <br /><br />
            35 Inches off to date!! 
            <br /><br />
            Some of Audrey‚Äôs biggest losses have been 7 Inches around her waist; 7 Inches off her lower abs; 7 Inches off her mid thigh. And still going strong. Below is her testimonial:
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúI have been attending Cura Fitness for a year now and I have to admit that I love it! I never thought I would be deliberately (without the help of my child!) waking up at 5am to go and do gym work. I had put on a lot of weight after having my child, my fitness levels were atrocious and I struggled to walk the dog without being out of puff.
            <br /><br />
            I have tightness in my joints which can make any jumping and some kinds of lifting very hard. I have left many gyms and classes previously due to being unsupervised and lifting badly or using equipment wrong, resulting in hurting my back or hip and then being too sore to return.
            <br /><br />
            Liz took all of this onboard and has helped me to adapt exercises to suit my body and ability, while still ensuring I get a serious full workout. The workouts are only half an hour and this means I am not missing out on precious time with my child yet still staying healthy.
            <br /><br />
            Liz ensures there are workouts at times of the day to suit working days and mums, and also to suit people who have school age children or tight schedules. Liz, Trisha and the team at Cura Fitness have become friends to me and I feel like I can talk to them about any issues or queries I may have, regarding my health, my fitness or ability to attend, or just to have a giggle with!
            <br /><br />
            I now have a set of ‚Äòguns‚Äô to be proud of and want my goal this year to work on my ‚Äòmummy core‚Äô. Thank you to everyone at Cura Fitness for helping me to become a better me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and a huge thank you from my dog who loves being brought on a walk now as he gets a good hour at a fast trot!‚Äù

            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúI joined Cura Fitness last January as I didn‚Äôt feel good in my own skin, and I had no energy and wanted to do something for myself. I hated the thought of attending the ‚Äògym‚Äô. I also wanted something that I could enjoy and would fit around my busy family life.
            <br /><br />
            Cura Fitness was everything I needed. 30 minute classes with other women who were there for the same reasons as myself. It was also very clear that Liz cared about each individual person that attended the classes. Within 6 weeks, I was sleeping better and had more energy. Liz measured me and I had 8 inches off.
            <br /><br />
            In April, Liz approached me, asking if I would be interested in joining her team as a fitness instructor. I was taken aback, overwhelmed but so touched that she could see the potential in me, which at that point I couldn‚Äôt see in myself. I completed my level 2 fitness instructor course in May and went on to become an RT24 coach. It has been the best decision I ever made, I love teaching and helping the ladies to achieve their goals.‚Äú
