            <br /><br />

          Congratulations to the amazing Marion Fleming who came 1st and won the 15 Week Challenge!!üëë
          <br /><br />
          The 1st photo was in August (right before the Challenge started), and the 2nd was taken 17th December. 
          <br /><br />
          Marion lost -30.8 inches along with -24.4lbs!! 
          <br /><br />
          She lost -4 inches off her arms, just over -8 inches off her chest + waist, -6.5 inches off her belly button, -5 inches off her hips, -6.5 inches off her thighs + calves. 
          <br /><br />
          She looks like a different person, and so toned! And Marion brought her food diary in every week for review, and ate such a varied diet - but fish + salad was definitely her go-to, along with nuts, seeds and also the intermittent fasting worked exceptionally well for both Marion, and her partner Denise (who came 2ndü•≥!).
          <br /><br />
          Marion initially came to me during lockdown to start building her core, due to bulging discs in her back. She also has struggled with a few other injuries along the way but we always adapted and she has gone from strength to strength üí™ I am so proud of you, Marion, and couldn't ask for a better friend/s in my life (including Denise of course) as you 2 always encourage, support and look after me, so thank you‚ù§
          <br /><br />
          Delighted for you!!

            <br /><br />
            A massive congratulations to Claire Campbell, who came 3rd in the 15 Week Challenge and lost -24.9 inches, along with -13.2lbs!ü•≥
            <br /><br />
            Claire lost a massive -8 inches from her belly button alone! Along with -4 off her arms, -4.5 off waist + chest, -8.5 off hips + legs!!
            <br /><br />
            As everyone knows, this is not Claire's first rodeo when it comes to Challenges! This is her second time now achieving great success, as in the 2019 Challenge she came 1st and lost -22 inches along with just over 1 stone. So she actually lost most inches this year than ever. 
            <br /><br />
            The difference this year too, is that Claire regularly attends x2 Group Personal Training sessions per week, Circuits twice per week, and has been doing Pilates once a week for the past month to improve flexibility. She brought her food diary in every week for review and took on all of my feedback. She enjoyed birthdays, anniversary etc and certainly did not deprive herself. We were working on variety, food to fuel training and help to benefit health. I even got her taking fish oilsüôå
            <br /><br />
            I have no words for how proud I am of Claire. She has been my go-to over the past 3 years, especially during lockdowns and Challenges. She has become a great friend outside of work, and I think she is one of the best ladies I know when it comes to integrity and loyalty. 
            <br /><br />
            Outstanding work, Claire!üëè

            One of the highlights of 2021 was meeting this outstanding lady, Clare Farrell. We never would have met if it weren't for Zoom, and she has done incredibly well - as you can see the top photos were January 2021, and the bottom were taken today! Wow!! Same top - and it's literally becoming a dress! And check out the tone!!üòÆ
            <br /><br />
            Clare came 8th in the 15 Week Challenge with -15.7 inches off, along with just under half a stone in weightü•≥she joined as she "needed more Liz time in her life"(her wordsüòÇ) so fair play haha!
            <br /><br />
            However bigger picture! Since January she has lost 30 inches and her shape has completely changed. 
            <br /><br />
            Clare attends a Group Personal Training session, along with a 1:1 Personal Training session a week with myself. Once a week she also tries to complete one of my HITT sessions from our Facebook group (free to current clients) as we have found the combination works really well for her. 
            <br /><br />
            I am so proud of you, Clare. Not only fantastic results, but you're a fantastic person who puts 100% into everything. To see you grow in confidence this past few months makes me so happy, and you have been such a great support to me too, so thank you xx

          Around half way through Sandra did begin to struggle, but the fact she came in and did what she could - as longterm she wants to be healthier, both physically and mentally in herself, which is amazing.

            <br /><br />
            Congratulations to Nicola O'Neill who came 4th in the 15 Week Challenge, and lost -24 inches along with just over 15lbs! 
            <br /><br />
            Nicola's journey goes back to our Rugby Club days, however when I was doing my Personal Training qualification back in 2018, Nicola was my "fat loss" client, and trained 3 nights per week with me for 6 weeks. She did fantastic back then, but now with the added bonus of evidence based nutritional guidance (thanks to my Mac Nutrition studies) Nicola has made some changes to her diet, and no longer suffers with daily stomach pain caused by IBS. 
            <br /><br />
            Before, she did not know what a Low FODMAP diet was, yet now she is a help to others through her own experience and the bloating has reduced so much that she has a flat tummy (every time I measured I could see it getting flatter).
            <br /><br />
            From August '18 (first photo) to date Nicola has lost -37.5 inches and yet there is 1kg weight difference in these 2 photos. Just shows what knowledge of Nutrition and combined training can do! She has lost (to name a few) -5.5 inches off her belly button, -7 off chest + waist, -3 off hips, -11.5 inches off both thighs, -7.5 both arms. 
            <br /><br />
            Absolutely outstanding Nicola. So so proud of you. And thank you for sticking with me for the past 4 years‚ù§

            Congratulations to Kelly Loughran who came 7th in the 15 Week Challenge with  -15.7 inches, along with -9lbs off! Fantastic!
            <br /><br />
            Kelly did not have an easy time of it the past few weeks, so I was so proud she got back to us when she could and as a result, has just over-3 inches off her arms, -2 inches off her waist, -3 inches off her belly button, -3 inches off her hips, and -3.5 inches off her legs.  
            <br /><br />
            Along with encouraging everyone in the 6:45am Group, and dancing her way through most of the classü§£or asking "how many reps?", she always keeps the group entertained - for sure! And it sure wasn't as bubbly without her there for nearly 2 weeksüòú so thank you Kelly. Super proud of you, and grateful for your support this past (almost)2 years xx

            Congratulations to Sharon McCullough who came 6th in the 15 Week Challenge with over -16 inches off and -12.9 lbsüéâ
            <br /><br />
            Sharon has been with me now for almost 3 years, and this is the 2nd Challenge she has taken part in and done brilliant with her results. She has still enjoyed nights out, etc but has been consistent with her training and we definitely know accountability works best for Sharon.
            <br /><br />
            In her journey as a whole with Cura she has lost -24 inches! With -4.5 inches off her arms, -3 inches off her chest, -3 inches off her waist, -6 inches off her belly button, -3 inches off her hips, -4.5 off her legs.
            <br /><br />
            I'm so so proud of you, Sharon, and thank you for sticking by me these 3 years. You are such a great support to me, and look forward to continuing in January with Bootcamp            <br /><br />

            Another day, another fantastic set of results before our next Zoom Bootcamp kicks off on Monday 22nd February.

            Below is a client of mine who struggles mentally without training, and really feels guilty when she goes one week without training. We have been working on her learning how to rest for recovery, and to appreciate how hard she does work when she trains - and how getting on top of the eating makes a massive difference. Below is her very kind reviewüëá
            So proud of her progress!
            <br /><br />
            "I've been training with Liz for just over a year both in the gym and PT sessions and I have just finished the 6 week bootcamp. I was worried that an online bootcamp wouldn't be as effective as the gym but Liz has expertly tailored every session and has adapted it to suit equipment/levels etc! each session was different and although there were quite a few times I thought I was going to be sick after the bootcamp class I really enjoyed them!I must admit my eating hasn't been 100% on point and I have still noticed a difference in my body shape! I would definitely recommend bootcamp!"
            <br /><br />
            She also messaged when she sent me these photos to say "I haven't put these leggings on since I started the bootcamp and it was only today that I noticed a difference! my belly definitely isn't as bloated!can't wait for the next 1!"üí™

            <strong><em>Kelly Loughran:</em></strong> "So what can I say about Cura Fitness and the amazing Elizabeth who is behind it with her lovely hubby. I joined a year ago now mum and baby classes which were absolutely amazing. 
            <br /><br />
            Getting out with a very clingy baby leaving him not too far away but enough for me to get some space knowing he was welled looked after was fantastic.
            <br /><br />
            I felt so welcome and at home the minute I stepped in to cura such a friendly atmosphere and great fun too everyone making me feel so welcome.
            <br /><br />
            Unfortunately as we know lock down happened and everyones desire to stay fit took a tumble and so did motivation. In steps Liz absolutely amazing setting up on line zoom bootcamp motivating us and despite everything this year has threw at her business wise still is.
            <br /><br />
            Bootcamp is a fantastic not only health life saver for me physically but mentally too. I for one would be lost without the constant support and pushing liz gives us especially when needed.
            <br /><br />
            Liz is not only a pt to me but an amazing friend just at the end off the phone willing to help no matter what. Excellent for nutrition advise and amazing at keeping us motivated thanks so much. #femalefitness #knowyourworth #wegotthistogether "

            Another set of fantastic 6 week results this morning!
            <br /><br />
            With -9.6 lbs off, along with just over -19 inches off all over, this client is delighted with her progress to date (as am I! Amazing!) Including -3 inches off chest, -2.5 inches off belly button and 8.5 inches off both thighs!
            <br /><br />
            You can really see the changes in the photos below, and i know she will continue to progress into the next 6 week Bootcamp (along with my Barbell class on Saturdays).
            <br /><br />
            These ladies have changed physically, in fitness, and yet grown in knowledge and strength.
            What do they all have in common? Goals! And the accountability of 6 weeks training! They will all tell you it has been tough, and they have struggled, but they have not quit.
            <br /><br />
            Proud of you all! See you on the 22nd February for 6 more weeksüòä

            Another fantastic set of results from another Zoom Bootcamp member who attended all 6 weeks, along with my Saturday Barbell class.
            <br /><br />
            She really knuckled down on her eating - adding more vegetables to her meals, increased protein, introduced some intermittent fasting - and the result is a phenomenal -33 inches off (almost 6 inches off her belly button alone, and 10 inches off both thighs!) along with -16.5lbs!!
            <br /><br />
            Super proud, as not only has she worked hard, but been a great support to Cura over the past year. If it weren't for lockdown we may never have met, so I'm grateful for the clients like her who have become friends and have trusted me with their fitness and nutrition journey. I am on my nutrition journey myself, with #MacNutritionUni as an #MNUStudent2020 and love sharing my knowledge to date with my clients and seeing the difference this makes!

            <img src="/images/clairecampbell-300x300.jpg" alt="Claire Campbell" />
            </div>

            <br /><br />
            Better late than never (on my part)....a review by our 15 Week Challenge winner, Claire Campbell - thank you so much for this!
            <br /><br />
            "<strong>My 15 week challenge at Cura.</strong>
            <br /><br />
            I have really enjoyed taking part in this challenge. From the outset Liz provided us all with a wealth of information on eating well, providing a comprehensive booklet including tips on what we should and shouldn‚Äôt eat.
            <br /><br />
            She also included recommendations based on what she eats herself, which was really useful. At the start it was a bit difficult to get my head round the 40/30/30 percentage splits, but the app Liz recommended is excellent for keeping track of everything.
            <br /><br />
            Along with this Liz monitored my food diaries and let me know what changes to make, as a result I got the hang of it all pretty quickly with Liz‚Äôs support.
            <br /><br />
            Following Liz‚Äôs advice I started to see the results pretty quickly and I have to say I am eating more now than I have ever eaten before! Of course during the 15 weeks life goes on and I had family birthdays, my own birthday, wedding anniversary, nights out, overnight business trips, school mid-term, etc etc, all during this time. And I enjoyed every minute of these and didn‚Äôt deny myself anything!
            <br /><br />
            I just made sure that a ‚Äòday off plan‚Äô didn‚Äôt turn into a ‚Äòweek off plan‚Äô (it may have turned into a couple of days here and there J) and I got straight back on the wagon knowing Liz was monitoring my food diary!
            <br /><br />
            I think this is why the 15 weeks has just flown in ‚Äì I managed to achieve amazing results whilst still enjoying normal activities. What I‚Äôm taking from it is that it is a lifestyle change, one that I can maintain long term and not just a fad diet.
            <br /><br />
            During the 15 weeks I attended Liz‚Äôs boot camp classes 3 times a week and the circuits and ab blast on a Saturday morning. I really enjoy these classes as each and every one is different.
            <br /><br />
            Over the 15 weeks I feel my fitness has increased significantly, I am able to push myself harder and I‚Äôm lifting heavier weights. I see the benefits in my day to day life, such as my posture is improved, I‚Äôve more energy for running after the kids and the classes are a real stress buster!
            <br /><br />
            So although the challenge has come to an end, this is just the start for me‚Äì Liz has given me the tools and knowledge for me to keep going.
            <br /><br />
            Thanks so much to Liz, Trisha and Steph ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt have achieved what I have without your support and encouragement."            <br /><br />

            <br /><br />
            Liz has been great helping me, even though I stress her sometimes with my weekends out (!!)) but with her support and help I‚Äôve been able to achieve my goals and have had amazing results."

            The fabulous Tina Gartland is a different woman & has been with us since her trial week a year ago. She is part of the furniture, only missing classes to go on holiday, but ALWAYS working her training around her work schedule. She inspires others with her dedication. We are so proud of you Tina, & know Eva is too.
            <br /><br />
            Here is Tina‚Äôs testimonial as featured in Banbridge Chronicle:
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúI joined Cura Fitness in January 2018. At that time, due to bad health, I had gained a bit of weight which was getting me down!
            <br /><br />
            I had tried lots of different gyms, but hadn‚Äôt lost anything and was starting to loss hope! At Cura Fitness, I was made very welcome and at ease, as Liz was aware of my health conditions and told me to just go at my own pace and how to adapt the exercises that I wasn‚Äôt able to do!
            <br /><br />
            After a short space of time I could see my body shape changing, which encouraged me to keep at it! From I joined cura I have not only lost weight but my health both physically and mentally has improved. I also don‚Äôt feel like I am being judged for the things I can‚Äôt do as there are a lot of people who have health conditions which restricts what they can do, so everyone is so supportive!
            <br /><br />
            Through Cura I have made some lovely friends! My life has changed for the better which is all down to Cura Fitness and all their guidance and support‚Äù.

            Thank you to Charlene Ogle for her brilliant review below. We continue to be so very proud to have you as a member at Cura Fitness. You are driven, motivated & committed which is why you deserve these brilliant results.
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúI joined Cura Fitness almost one year ago and and am loving it and the results.
            I have tried many different gyms and exercise classes but never stuck them out, Cura Fitness changed all that. From the first time i entered Cura Fitness i was made to feel very welcome by both the Cura team and the other members and for once i didnt feel out of place in a gym setting.
            <br /><br />
            I attend Cura 3 times a week and do a variety of classes including circuits, core and RT24. There really is something to suit everyone.
            My body shape has really improved, im much more toned, so much fitter and above all so much happier in myself.
            <br /><br />
            I can‚Äôt recommend Cura Fitness highly enough, it is really great fun, good laugh and it works. The atmosphere is non judgemental and all the girls encourage each other.
            <br /><br />
            Thank you everyone at Cura Fitness for helping me achieve my goals‚Äù

            So proud of my lovely PT Client, Catherine, who first came on with us through Boot Camp one year ago. She did brilliantly well during the 6 weeks, and lost -18 inches. After which, she joined as a Member and continued to grow in strength and fitness.
            <br /><br />
            In September she came on with me as a PT Client and took part in the 15 Week Challenge. The other 2 ladies in her PT group were a brilliant support, and really rallied behind Catherine as week after week she continued to progress in every way. Catherine lost 17 inches during the Challenge and a total of 17.8lbs! This was with a few trips away and other events thrown into the mix.
            <br /><br />
            Around this she worked really hard to plan her meals and stay consistent in her nutrition. As a result she came 6th in the Challenge üéâAnd in her One Rep Max Squat Test before Christmas she achieved a ORM of 107.5kg. Outstanding!
            <br /><br />
            Catherine has lost a total of -3.5 off her arms, -3 inches off her chest, -4 inches off her waist, -6.5 inches off her belly button, -3 inches off her hips and a massive 10 inches off both legs!

            Catherine's Review after the 15 Week Challenge üëá
            <br /><br />
            "I‚Äôve been a member at Cura almost 1 year now. My goals when joining were to lose weight, get fit and find something that I enjoy so that I can stick with! During this time I am happy to say I have achieved all 3 goals.
            <br /><br />
            When Liz announced the 15 week challenge I was definitely keen to take part. This was the extra push and motivation that I needed after enjoying the summer üòä
            <br /><br />
            During these 15 weeks there were many challenges, between holidays and weekends away. Liz was always on hand offering support and guidance at any time it was needed, night or day. Whether it was suggestions on food options, and just the general encouragement that I needed.
            <br /><br />
            Liz also went out of her way to accommodate any weigh-ins/measurements, always at a time suitable for me even when she was not due to be working. I don‚Äôt know of anywhere else you would get this level of commitment."
            <br /><br />
            So proud of you and what you have achieved, Catherine, and I know will continue to achieve in 2020!            <br /><br />

            Sarah McCahon, we are all SO proud of your progress in (almost) the last year. Sarah is so dedicated, that she was back in training on the 27th December as soon as we re-opened after the Christmas break. You deserve these fab results, Sarah, & you‚Äôre looking amazing!!
            <br /><br />
            Read Sarah‚Äôs testimonial below:
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúAfter feeling I needed to do something to lose weight, a friend recommended Cura to me and it honestly was the best decision I could have made to join in April 18. I have met some amazing people and made some life friends through the classes and instructors.
            <br /><br />
            They are always there to help motivate and give advice and are always there to help me along the way. Since joining, I have lost a total of 21.5 inches, have gained more confidence in myself and it has helped dramatically with my anxiety and overthinking.
            <br /><br />
            There is such a variety of classes to choose from each week and I would highly recommend Cura Fitness to anyone who wants and is willing to make a change in their life for the better. I could not speak highly enough of the instructors and honestly could not have got to where I am today without them.‚Äù

            Thank you so much for these fantastic photos Linda Wills along with your brilliant testimonial below. We love having you as part of Cura. You show such strength & dedication. Your body shape has changed completely & we are all so proud of you.
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúI joined Cura Fitness in March 2018 after winning a Facebook competition for one months free classes. Once i started i was instantly hooked. I hadn‚Äôt exercised in some time and was fearful getting back into exercise due to underlying health conditions, however i was worrying for nothing.
            <br /><br />
            The small group size suited me brilliantly and i felt like no-one was judging me if i was slow or didn‚Äôt know the exercises. Liz was always on hand to adjust any i was having difficulty with and i always felt that i left the classes feeling a great sense of achievement.
            <br /><br />
            Ten months later i am loving exercise again! I am stronger fitter and healthier than i have been in some time having lost over 35 inches to date and have a new found love of burpees and while i still have challenges at times i‚Äôm excited to see what 2019 brings. Thank you Cura!‚Äù

            I am SO proud of this amazing lady, who I am privileged to call my friend, & one of the most kindest, loyal people I know ‚Äì Audrey Docherty.
            <br /><br />
            She has been by my side from that first trial week in Jan ‚Äô18 at the Rugby Club & still attends her 3 morning classes every week, no matter the weather.
            <br /><br />
            35 Inches off to date!! 
            <br /><br />
            Some of Audrey‚Äôs biggest losses have been 7 Inches around her waist; 7 Inches off her lower abs; 7 Inches off her mid thigh. And still going strong. Below is her testimonial:
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúI have been attending Cura Fitness for a year now and I have to admit that I love it! I never thought I would be deliberately (without the help of my child!) waking up at 5am to go and do gym work. I had put on a lot of weight after having my child, my fitness levels were atrocious and I struggled to walk the dog without being out of puff.
            <br /><br />
            I have tightness in my joints which can make any jumping and some kinds of lifting very hard. I have left many gyms and classes previously due to being unsupervised and lifting badly or using equipment wrong, resulting in hurting my back or hip and then being too sore to return.
            <br /><br />
            Liz took all of this onboard and has helped me to adapt exercises to suit my body and ability, while still ensuring I get a serious full workout. The workouts are only half an hour and this means I am not missing out on precious time with my child yet still staying healthy.
            <br /><br />
            Liz ensures there are workouts at times of the day to suit working days and mums, and also to suit people who have school age children or tight schedules. Liz, Trisha and the team at Cura Fitness have become friends to me and I feel like I can talk to them about any issues or queries I may have, regarding my health, my fitness or ability to attend, or just to have a giggle with!
            <br /><br />
            I now have a set of ‚Äòguns‚Äô to be proud of and want my goal this year to work on my ‚Äòmummy core‚Äô. Thank you to everyone at Cura Fitness for helping me to become a better me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and a huge thank you from my dog who loves being brought on a walk now as he gets a good hour at a fast trot!‚Äù
