            2.5 stone off to date for this fantastic Bootcamp member, who started training with me last September.  
            <br /><br />
            Her consistency, and hard work (opting for the heavier over light weights) have payed off - adding in some additional strength work in Group Personal Training since the new year. 
            I have seen her body shape change so much in the past 8 months, and as she's mentioned to me before, she struggled to stick at training elsewhere - not really noticing any change in shape until she started Bootcamp. 
            As the classes are designed for females, by a female (me!)...I definitely know why she has seen such incredible resultsüòä
            <br /><br />
            Super proud of you!
            <br /><br />
            In her own words:
            <br /><br />
            "I ate my feelings but having class to go to 3 times a week I was able to focus on those instead. I struggled with lack of any fitness when I started class but with consistently showing up I can do things now I never dreamed I would be able to. 
            How every day tasks are easier with having lost the weight and with being stronger. I have really enjoyed being able to go at my own pace but always being pushed by you to try and improve. Best kind of training ü•∞"
            <br /><br />
            Keep up the brilliant worküí™I've really enjoyed getting to know you, and thank you for letting me share your progress photos from last summer to todayüòä    
            <br /><br />

            Where do I start....
            This incredible woman pictured below started training with us way back in 2020 - literally pre-lockdown, when we ran the "Mum's Return To Fitness" classes. 
            Obviously circumstances changed as we moved online, but we stayed in touch and she returned to studio classes as soon as we re-opened. 
            <br /><br />
            The first photo here is from last summer, as due to some personal circumstances she wasn't able to attend all 3 Bootcamp classes each week, and she knew herself her nutrition wasn't where it should be. 
            Over the past 6 months, she has shown incredible determination - cutting back on processed foods/mindless snacking, is in a very active job that requires some physical strength, so she has really focused on attending the classes each week and fuelling better around her busy schedule. 
            She is not obsessed with the scales or "quick fixes", instead she wants to feel healthier and I have seen her body shape change so much since the new year. 
            <br /><br />
            I also want to comment on how amazing a person she is. She is honest, loyal, kind and has stuck by me through thick and thin. I'm very grateful to be surrounded by ladies like her. An inspiration ‚ù§Ô∏è          
          <br /><br />

          <div className="u-textCenter">

          <img src="/images/success-story-3-2025.jpg" alt="Karen 2025" />
          </div>
          <br /><br />

          Back in September 2022, Karen contacted me regarding starting one-to-one personal training with me once a week. 
          Having both Fibromyalgia, Underactive Thyroid and having gone through early menopause in her late 20's; Karen was quite anxious about getting started, and in her words from her review a few years ago: "hadn‚Äôt exercised for years was very overweight and was starting to find my mobility was getting more and more limited. That coupled with extreme fatigue and a terrible sleep pattern due to pain (sometimes only managing 2hrs of sleep a night and sometimes none at all) I was anxious about starting to exercise". 
          <br /><br />
          In the time she has trained with me, Karen has had great progressive weeks, and not so great weeks with her health, so we take full advantage of the good, and work with her mobility the best we can. She tells me all the time how as her PT I know exactly what she is capable of, and the mix of moderate strength work coupled with Pilates helps with her aches and pains. 
          To date Karen has lost almost 2 stone in weight, along with 30 inches. Her biggest losses being -6 inches off her belly button, -3 inches off her chest, -4 inches off her hips, -3.5 inches off her waist, -8 inches off both arms, -6 inches off her legs. 
          I have noticed her shape change and she looks so much healthier and happier in herself. She is now down 2 dress sizes from starting her journeyüòä
          <br /><br />
          "Liz was recommended to me and I decided to take the plunge and started with Liz once a week with a one to one lesson. Liz was so welcoming and assuring and put me at ease right away. 
          After discussing my health details and any concerns I had she chatted about what I wanted to achieve during our classes. 
          <br /><br />
          She has helped my mobility tenfold - from being unable to get out of a chair unaided I can now do this for myself. I was unable to pick things up if I dropped them and certainly was unable to get up off the floor if I ever managed to get down in the first place.
          She has helped and encouraged me at my pace and has always been professional and knowledgeable regarding my issues.
          <br /><br />
          I would highly recommend Liz without hesitation to anyone who is considering availing of her services."
          <br /><br />
          On a personal note, I have loved every moment of getting to know Karen. She is one of the most loyal, kindest ladies I know. We have had many a laugh, and maybe the odd emotional moment too (mostly me haha), and I'm incredibly grateful to her for putting her trust in me for the past few years. I love that you have worked healthily towards your goal for turning 60, Karen. To see you improve in confidence and energy has been a joy to see‚ù§Ô∏è

            Massive congratulations to the Winner of The 15 Week Challenge, Marion Fleming üëè
            <br /><br />
            Marion attended my Bootcamp 3 mornings per week, and also sent her food diary to me every Monday - taking on feedback for better nutrition, and her incredible results are very obvious in the photo below - including -5.3 inches off her arms (flexed & unflexed), -3.8 inches off her chest, -4.8 inches off her waist, -7.4 inches off her belly button, -3.8 inches off her hips, -5.4 inches off both legs (thighs & calves). Total of -30.8 inches!! Unreal. 
            All this and a big 60th birthday last month too!!ü•≥We didn't focus on the scales - only taking baseline weight, midpoint and final weight - however Marion lost -9.3kg (over 20lbs) over the 15 Weeks. Her shape has completely changed, and she is healthier and happier in herself. 
            <br /><br />
            Marion sent me a very kind review below:
            <br /><br />
            ‚ÄúI am delighted with my results at Cura. Liz has supported me every step of the way, as she does with all her clients. In addition to her training knowledge she is fully qualified in nutrition and Pilates. When I hit a plateau she knew exactly what to recommend to get me back on track. And when I lacked motivation she was there to spur me on and encourage me. In Cura there is such a non judgmental, supportive community of women who all look out for each other - it truly is a unique gym experience. Thank you to everyone‚Äôs support‚Äù

          Congratulations to the runner up of The 15 Week Challenge Denise Medea üëè
          <br /><br />
          Denise showed 100% dedication throughout with taking on feedback (including green veg ha!), and like Marion, attended Bootcamp 3 mornings per week; and despite her health not being 100% more recently, has lost -28.5 inches along with -16.7lbs!
          Inch losses were -5.3 inches off her arms, -3.8 inches off her chest, -4.8 inches off her waist, -7.4 inches off her belly button, -3.8 inches off her hips, -5.4 inches off both legs. 
          <br /><br />

          <br /><br />
          Denise very kindly wrote the following review:
          <br /><br />
          "i am extremely happy with my results. Liz has supported me every step of the way especially during this challenge. Liz is very passionate and provides support to all her clients. In addition to her training knowledge she is fully qualified in nutrition which has been extremely beneficial when struggling to find foods that work for weight loss and building strength . When times were tough and I lacked motivation she was always there to encourage me. In Cura there is a very supportive group of women who all look out for each other and have some fun along the way. Everyone gets along and it is a very welcoming place."

          Congratulations to Sarah Devlin who came 3rd in The 15 Week Challenge üëè
          <br /><br />
          Sarah lost a total of 22.6 inches! Including -4.5 inches off both arms, -2.4 inches off her waist, -7.5 inches off her belly button, -3.5 inches off her hips, and -4.2 inches off both legs. 
          Scales were not the focus of the Challenge however Sarah lost -1.9kg, showing that body shape can change significantly regardless of the reading of the scales. I know that Sarah feels so much better in herself now, which is most important. 
          <br /><br />
          Sarah very kindly wrote me the review below:
          <br /><br />
          "In May 2024 I decided to join my first bootcamp at Cura Fitness and this gym has changed my life! Liz is the most knowledgeable, patient and caring coach I could have wished for. She has taught me so much about fuelling my body properly and has brought back my love for exercise. I will be forever grateful to Liz for what she has done for me and I can‚Äôt wait to continue training with her."
          <br /><br />
          Well done, Sarah! Very proud of youüòäoh and I should also add, between May and the Challenge starting, Sarah's shape had already significantly changed as she attended classes over the summer, and we chatted about nutrition quite a bit. So her results in 7 months have been brilliant üëè

          Congratulations to Audrey who came 4th in The 15 Week Challengeüëè
          <br /><br />
          Audrey consistently lost inches, with each 3-weekly measurement and we really drilled down into ensuring she got enough protein and essential fats and carbohydrates to fuel her pescatarian diet. We faced some challenges - literally - but all feedback was taken on as diaries were sent consistently each week. 
          <br /><br />
          As a result Audrey lost -21.9 inches along with 4kg (8.8lbs)üëè
          <br /><br />
          A few losses included -4.1 inches off her arms, -1.5 inches off her chest, -2.8 inches off her waist, -5.4 inches off her belly button, -2.5 inches off her hips and -5.6 inches off both legs. Fantastic workü•≥
          <br /><br />
          Audrey very kindly wrote the review below:
          <br /><br />
          "I started the 15 week challenge with Liz to push myself for greater accountability, knowing that food I was eating was even more important that the exercise. Liz made me realise very quickly that I needed to increase my protein intake, and whilst this wasn't always easy, I definitely feel the benefits and realise that with good nutrition I feel more satisfied and don't snack as much.  Liz encouraged and motivated me every step of the way and even told me off, if she needed to! Liz and all the team in Cura are so supportive and encouraging. I really enjoy the bootcamp and Pilates classes and definitely feel the benefit!  Roll on the next bootcamp classes in the new year!  Thanks a million Liz. You are Fab!"
          <br /><br />
          Thanks so much for this, and for your support from February this year. I'm very proud of you, and so glad you've felt the benefits üòç

            Congratulations to Geraldine who came 5th in The 15 Week Challengeüëè
            <br /><br />
            Geraldine lost -20.3 inches during the Challenge, along with 7.2lbs!! Which alone is fantastic, however these photos below are her long-term progress photos dating back from 2018 to now. 
            <br /><br />
            Since starting Cura Fitness back in June 2018, Geraldine has lost -74.9 inches and -28.6lbs in total to date. 
            <br /><br />
            Her losses in 6+ years include -7.2 inches off her chest, -8.5 inches off her waist, -11.2 inches off her belly button, -23.4 inches off both arms flexed + unflexed combined, -20.6 inches off both legs (thighs and calves). 
            Absolutely incredible. I'm so very proud of you Geraldine. You have had your ups and downs over the years, but the change in your shape is so noticeable, and you've worked hard this past year to improve your nutrition. 
            <br /><br />
            Geraldine very kindly wrote me the following review (apart from the spurs & music bitü§™you can thank spotify smart shuffle i told herüòÇ): 
            <br /><br />
            "I joined Cura Fitness in (what year lol) and have never regretted it, although sometimes when that 5.20 alarm goes off I do lol
            During this time I have lost weight, put on weight, lost it again etc.. but never have I been scolded or judged, I have been accepted, encouraged and pushed. The classes have helped me with my stress levels, sleep, eating habits and strength. Our 6 am class has a great bunch of girls who are encouraging and up for a laugh at that time of the morning. Liz has been super throughout these years, working with me to adapt exercises, encouraging me to push myself, and her on-going training and learning has benefitted me greatly. She is so committed to helping and encouraging women to becoming the best versions of themselves! The only negatives are she is a spurs fan and sometimes her taste in music üé∂  Thanks Liz for all you do, I for one truly appreciate it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
            <br /><br />
            Geraldine proves consistency is key, and to keep showing up and working on your goals longterm. Super proud! Well done!

<br /><br />

Congratulations to Alison who came 6th in The 15 Week Challenge üëè
<br /><br />
During the Challenge, Alison lost -19.8 inches, along with -4.7kg (-10.3lbs), with a few of her inch losses being -4.2 inches off her waist, -2.1 inches off her belly button and -2.6 inches off her chest. 
<br /><br />
Alison started Bootcamp in January and has achieved fantastic results year to date, with -25.7 inches now off , along with -10.2kg (-22.4lbs) off year to date - with -5.2 off her waist, -4.5 inches off her belly button, -4 inches off her chest, -3.1 inches off her hips. 
Alison enjoys her walks, and also has consistently attended Bootcamp all year. I helped her with her nutrition, and as a coeliac this proves she can have a healthier more varied lifestyle whilst still losing inches and growing stronger. 
<br /><br />
Well done Alison. Very proud of you ü•≥
<br /><br />
Alison's very kind review is below: 
<br /><br />
"I've been doing Bootcamps at Cura from January this year, and Liz has been nothing but supportive from my first day.  The whole group of ladies are great fun, which definitely helps with the early morning starts. From I started, I have slowly lost some weight and introduced healthier eating habits, but I have got much stronger.  
After the summer, I decided to join the Cura 15-week Challenge to give myself the push to end the year well.  It wasn't always easy, Liz encouraged us all from week one, giving great nutritional  advice, highlighting the importance of protein,  the impact of stress, and  poor sleep.  She provided sound advice every week when reviewing my food diary.  My sleep has been a problem for some time, but I can definitely say that completing this challenge has helped improve my sleep habits.  Overall, I am very pleased with my results and am looking forward to the next boot camp in the New Year.  Thank you, Liz."
